# BellaBeat Case Study: Data Analysis in Python

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to a popular wellness and fitness tracking device, Fitbit( [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)). The analysis is conducted using Python, employing libraries such as pandas, seaborn, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Data Analysis Process
1. **Data Importation**: The dataset is loaded using pandas.
2. **Data Inspection**: Basic information about the dataset is examined, including data types and non-null values.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Missing data is checked, and necessary data type conversions are performed.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Correlation between total distance traveled and calories burnt is explored.
   - Distribution of total burnt calories by users is visualized.
   - Average tracked time by the device is calculated to understand the device's data collection efficiency.
   - Correlation between sleep data and calories burnt is examined.
5. **Data Visualization**: Various plots such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and pairplots are created to visualize correlations and distributions.

## Key Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Insights
The analysis aims to provide insights into user behavior and device efficiency, helping in the manufacturing of a similar but improved tracking device.
